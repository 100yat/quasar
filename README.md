# Ñ£ project (Yat)

Yat is an open, unchangeable and provable ledger; a system that allows you to transparently monitor the movements of funds within yourself.

Yat is not a ruble, not a cryptocurrency and not a payment system - it is an exchange of values, rights and obligations.

Yat are smart contracts that are concluded as simply as a handshake.

It is based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) - a chain of transactions, where each next one confirms the legitimacy of the previous one. This is achieved thanks to the hashing system - the generation of unique digital fingerprints of data and their connection into a single oriented structure. The slightest attempts to manipulate its history will immediately and avalanche-like lead to the unreliability of the entire chain. Such a feature makes such actions meaningless, because anyone can algorithmically check the open history and make sure of its integrity.
